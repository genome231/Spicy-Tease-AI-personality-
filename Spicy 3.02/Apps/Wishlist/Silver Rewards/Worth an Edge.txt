Well this is a nice surprise
Looks like somebody bought me a little present from my Wishlist today #EmoteHappy
Tell me honestly #SubName...
Did you do that just to be nice, or were you hoping to get some kind of reward?
[nice] Oh well, since you <i>only</i> did it to be nice...
[reward] Is that right... @Goto(It Worked)
@DifferentAnswer Just tell me if you were being nice or wanted a reward #PetName
I guess there's no point in me trying to give you anything in return #Grin
So I guess I'll just very sweetly say thank you
And let you get back to what you were doing
But don't worry #SubName
If you <i>were</i> actually hoping for something more
You know where to find me

(It Worked)
Well it totally worked #Lol
I do feel like giving you something in return like this
And I think this gift is at least worth an edge
So why don't you take that #Cock out of your pants
And get it close for me @Edge
#LetTheEdgeFade
There now, I think that was a nice reward for thinking of me #GeneralTime
I'll let you get back to saving up more tokens for me
But if you want to put that #Cock through something more serious than a little edge
I won't be hard to find #SubName
