Stop stroking for a minute #PetName @StopStroking
Remember when I talked about the level of ache I want you to feel?
The thing is...
It takes more than waving a sexy picture in front of your face
It even takes more than my teasing little words worming their way into your ear while you stroke
No
In order to get to the level of ache I want
You're #Gonna have to spend a little time on the edge #PetName #Grin
Edge for me right now @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
Stopping like that when you're so close
Even once
Is enough to make a ruined orgasm feel three times as worse as it would have
So you can imagine how much worse it's #Gonna feel
After I make you edge again #Grin
Get to the edge right now @EdgeNoHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
#EmoteMoan
Starting and stopping like that
Starting and stopping
It's just so frustrating I know #EmoteHappy
So when I make you edge again for me in a second
I won't make you stop
I'll just make you hold it this time #Grin
Edge @EdgeHold
#LetTheEdgeFade
@End
