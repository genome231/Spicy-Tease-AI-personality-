I love the thought of you sitting there in your chair @Chance50(Waiting For My Word)
Squirming with all that ache
Desperate to touch yourself
Even though you know it would only make the ache so much worse
The thing is
I <i>want</i> the ache to be so much worse #Grin @Chance50(Start Stroking)
Sooo...
(Start Stroking)
#StartStroking @StartStroking
@End
(Waiting For My Word)
Waiting for my word
Wondering what I'm #Gonna make you do
Well you don't have to wonder #PetName, I'll tell you
I'm going to make you suffer #EmoteRandom
Start stroking @StartStroking
@End
