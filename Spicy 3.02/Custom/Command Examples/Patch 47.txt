@EmoteMessage #DomName smiles @TyposOff
Hello #SubName, nice to see you
Before we get started I highly recommend that you uncheck any of my Typing Style options you have enabled
Some of this might be hard to follow if I'm stuck typing in lowercase #EmoteHappy
So you're probably curious about the new Commands available in Patch 47
There's not too many this time
Most of the work has gone into the AI Box system and the new Domme Tags app
But I do have a couple new tricks up my sleeve #Grin
For starters, there's the new ATSYMBOLInputVar[] Command @
When this Command is used, the current linear script will stop while I wait for you to input an answer
So if the script had this line:
"What's your favorite band? ATSYMBOLInputVar[Ex_FavoriteBand]" 
Then I would wait for you to type, and whatever you entered I would then store that as Variable called "Ex_FavoriteBand" 
Let's give that a try now @RapidTextOn
What's your favorite band? @InputVar[Ex_FavoriteBand] @RapidTextOff
Great, I've now stored what you just typed as the Variable "Ex_FavoriteBand"
Of course, before I couldn't say Variables that weren't numbers
But now I can use ATSYMBOLShowVar[] to show words and phrases as well 
How else would I be able to tell you that @ShowVar[Ex_FavoriteBand] is your favorite band? #EmoteHappy
You can even use the ATSYMBOLInputVar[] in front of a Multiple Choice branch if you want, like this:
What's your favorite movie #SubName? @InputVar[Ex_FavoriteMovie]
[American Beauty] That's my favorite movie too! I love Kevin Spacey #EmoteHappy
[Lord of the Rings, LOTR] My one ring would be a cock ring #Lol
[Star Wars, Empire Strikes, Jedi] Just call me Darth #DomName #Lol
[Godfather] Good choice, I like making offers you can't refuse too #Grin
[Furious] I love the Fast and Furious movies #EmoteHappy
[Lion King] I'm still not over Mufasa T.T
[Clerks] I'm not even supposed to be here today! #Lol
@AcceptAnswer That's a good one #EmoteHappy
Check out this script in an editor if you want to see how it looks
Now the ATSYMBOLShowVar[] hasn't just been improved to show strings as well as integers
You can now use as many of them in the same line that you want
So I could tell you that your favorite band is @ShowVar[Ex_FavoriteBand] and your favorite movie is @ShowVar[Ex_FavoriteMovie]
Usually you want variables like that to stick around
But since this is just an example script I don't really need them anymore so I'll use ATSYMBOLDeleteVar[] to get rid of them
I can't use more than one ATSYMBOLDeleteVar[] in a line, so I'll just use a couple of ATSYMBOLNullResponse Commands behind the scenes
@NullResponse @DeleteVar[Ex_FavoriteBand]
@NullResponse @DeleteVar[Ex_FavoriteMovie]
Ugh, speaking of ATSYMBOLNullResponse Commands...
They're great for running other Commands discretely and pulling off some complex stuff
But when you start getting complicated and using a lot of them it can really slow things down, even if you use the ATSYMBOLRapidTextOn Command
Let me show you what I mean, here's 30 ATSYMBOLNullResponse Commands in a row with ATSYMBOLRapidTextOn
(Rapid Code)
This should take about 30 seconds, but bear with me and I promise it will be worth it #EmoteHappy
@NullResponse @RapidTextOn
@NullResponse 
@NullResponse

So that wasn't <i>too</i> bad, but it still wasted like 30 seconds just to basically run code @RapidTextOff
That's why there's the new Command ATSYMBOLRapidCodeOn
ATSYMBOLRapidCodeOn will skip through all lines containing ATSYMBOLNullResponse while <i>still</i> running any Commands on those lines
You can turn it off manually with ATSYMBOLRapidCodeOff, but it will also disable itself automatically when it reaches a line that does not contain ATSYMBOLNullResponse
To show you what I mean...
Let's go through those 30 ATSYMBOLNullResponse lines again, this time with ATSYMBOLRapidCodeOn

Guess what? It's already gone through all 30 lines #EmoteHappy
So now if you do have to write complicated code in the future, you don't have to worry about bogging everything down
But if you want a little inside dirt, I can tell you...
The more that 1885 works on Total Brat, the more powerful the Tease AI scripting language becomes
And hopefully less and less of that kind of complicated stuff will be necessary to get the results we want #EmoteHappy
Speaking of the results we want, let's talk about Interrupts for a second
They're really useful when you think about it, but they can also really screw up certain scripts
That's why there's a new Command I think you're gonna like if you're a scripter: ATSYMBOLInterruptsOff
Right now if you asked me to let you start stroking, we'd end up breaking out of this script
But I just turned Interrupts off, so take the next couple of moments to ask me to let you start stroking while I count to ten @InterruptsOff
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Okay turning them back on now with ATSYMBOLInterruptsOn @InterruptsOn
This doesn't just work for stroking Interrupts, this will intercept almost any kind of Interrupt that could have occurred, with the exception of Safewords
So that about wraps it up for the new Commands in Patch 47
If you have any questions about anything, please ask in the Open Beta thread
Also, don't tell 1885 but I caught a glimpse of some stuff he's working on for Patch 48, check this out:
We're in a Linear type script, right?
But without using any new Commands at all, I can tell you...
@CockSmall That I think you have a pretty small cock #Lol
@CockAverage That I think you have an average-sized cock
@CockLarge That I think you have a pretty big cock #EmoteHappy
Yeah
I don't know how he did it, but it looks like Command Filters are gonna be usable in Linear type scripts soon!
