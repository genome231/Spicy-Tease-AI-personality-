@SystemMessage #GNMVA I need to know what sort of spanking implements you have
@SystemMessage #GNMVA I expect you to have at least 3 #GNMGrin
@SystemMessage #GNMVA One of them should preferably be sort of medium implement
@SystemMessage #GNMVA Not too stingy..
@SystemMessage #GNMVA The second should be a hard implement
@SystemMessage #GNMVA One that definetly leaves a sting
@SystemMessage #GNMVA And the third should be a really nasty one!
@SystemMessage #GNMVA One that strikes terror into your heart #GNMGrin
@SystemMessage #GNMVA So tell me slave 
@SystemMessage #GNMVA What implement do you have that fits the first description? @InputVar[SpankingImplement1]
@SystemMessage #GNMVA Thats a good one..
@SystemMessage #GNMVA What implement do you have that fits the second description? @InputVar[SpankingImplement2]
@SystemMessage #GNMVA This should be giving us a fun time!..
@SystemMessage #GNMVA What nasty implement do you have that fits the first description? @InputVar[SpankingImplement3]
@SystemMessage #GNMVA Mhmm I can't wait to use this one!
@SystemMessage #GNMVA Well..
@SystemMessage #GNMVA I'm sure I'll have a good time with the @ShowVar[SpankingImplement1], @ShowVar[SpankingImplement2] and the @ShowVar[SpankingImplement3]
