Plans:
- Don't let domme always undress, ask domme to undress response
Bugs:
- BUG: Invalid width/length picture display
- BUG: Fix halloween bosses
Code:
- Start Stroking file instead of vocab to not have every line duplicated just for the sake of the metronome
Dialogue:
- Start dialogues
- Chastity Links
- End dialogues
- More Taunts
- More interactive stuff such as bind balls/penis, ice water, butt plug, kneel, stand, other position, colar, icy hot, pegs
- Ask to buy stuff, for example I'd do anything script
Planning:
- Tell her what days/nights you need to sleep well / are busy
Tasks:
- Night Tasks
 - No peeing (otherwise pee in bottle, consume?), cuff hands/feet, bind to bed/bondage, butt plug, vibrator, sleep on ground, sleep without pillow
- Daily Tasks/Weekly tasks
 - Wear panties, wear a max of x clothes, wear butt plug, wear vibrator, stinging nettle play, be always naked/lingerie when doing x
Settings for fetishes:
- CEI, CBT, Assplay, Ass to mouth, pain (clamps etc.), pee (missing is that it does not yet really apply)
Modules:
- Blowjob: laying on bed with face hanging down -> spit in face, collect spit for later use
- Sound play
- Ice Water play
- Cum Modules: On pillow sleep with it, into panties and wear for x, into socks and wear for x, toothbrush
- More and advanced chastity tasks
- Set ass and chastity level at start if you already have some experience
- Peg play more advanced = ropes etc., attach weights?
General:
- Enforcing personality and asking/soft personality. Enforcing is only limited by disabled fetishes

Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
@SetFlag/@DeleteFlag Supports multiple flags at once
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
@NullResponse @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000] works. No need for @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @NullResponse @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000]
@ShowVar[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)] does not work! Just use #DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
@SetVar is not required, @ChangeVar can also create a variable, @Flag(Personality1) @NullResponse @SetVar[BJTraining]=[0] @ChangeVar[BJTraining]=[BJTraining]+[#Random(20,45)] does not work! Sets variable to 0 but no change
You can use vocabs in vocabfiles
You can only use ChangeVar when using another variable in the equation (can be used to create new vars though) Example: @ChangeVar[Test]=[Test1]*[2]
You can only use SetVar when assigning just a value and no equation is present Example: @SetVar[Test]=[0]
@CustomMode(done, Goto, Continue2) @Wait(999999) goes to when a message contains done is written. "Done Mistress", or just "done" for example.
@RapidCodeOn works in front of normal messages to make them display instantly. However it does NOT work with answers: [slut] @RapidCodeOn okay @Goto(test)
@Variable[Test]=[0] does not work, use <= or >=, seems to work in vocab files
Getting or comparing an unknow variable will return the value 0 for the variable
#DateDifference an unknown date will result in the difference always being 0
You CANNOT generate a random number using variables as min or max range
@ChangeVar only supports ONE operation not multiple once like @ChangeVar[f]=[f]*[100]-[b]
Multiple @RT in one line WORK and #Vocab works inside @RT too

Important Setup:
All tagged sets must contain at least one picture with each tag (fully dressed, halfdressed etc.)
Session length from 600 - 1200 and no domme decide based on level! Restart tease ai every 600 minutes!
