Tadaa! #DTS1 @PlayAudio[GNMSounds\Specialsounds\Bell.mp3]
I think you will enjoy this #DTS1
At least I hope so #GNMEmoteHappy #DTS1
We're gonna play a bit with selfbondage! #DTS1
This scenario should last about 1 hour #DTS1
Would you be okay with that? #DTS1
[yes] #GNMGood #DTS1
[no] Awww #DTS1 @Goto(PresentAtLeast)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DTS1
Okay so lets not waste too much time! #GNMLol #DTS1
First do you have about 8 pegs and thin string to tie them together? #DTS1
[yes] #GNMGood #DTS1
[no] Awww #DTS1 @Goto(NeedGear)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DTS1
Next you'll need 2 shoelaces or similar, a pair of handcuffs and a somewhat long rope or string or similar #DTS1
Do you have this? #DTS1
[yes] #GNMGood #DTS1
[no] Awww #DTS1 @Goto(NeedGear)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DTS1
It seems you have everything you need #GNMGrin #DTS1
Read this very carefully. #DTS1
don't do anything yet, just read and look at this while you read @ShowImage[\GNMImages\SpecialDays\SubBirthday\Scenario.jpg] @LockImages
This is the scenario seen from the side
You'll need a table
You'll need the 2 shoelaces, use 1 to tie each of your feet to the table legs
Next
Put the thin string through the hole in the pegs connecting all of them
Next you'll need to meassure
You'll need to connect the string through the pegs with your handcuffs using a rope or string
Make sure the length is measured
You should be forced to be bended forward or pull on your balls
The handcuff keys should just be placed close to your stomach
Now the trick of this selfbondage scenario is that you can easily get free
All you have to do is pull the pegs of your #GNMBalls #GNMLol @UnlockImages
Now you might have other gear that you think will be perfect in this scenario #DTS1
Mark also added some electro stuff and a gag #DTS1
And oh my, if I remember correct he used about 50 pegs #DTS1
Some of them on his balls, cock and legs #DTS1
Well.. #DTS1
The way this is gonna play out is that you're gonna do the setup #DTS1
Report when you're ready #DTS1
I will then tell you, you have 3 minutes to get into the selfbondage #DTS1
Then I'll show you a video #DTS1
When the video is over you have my permission to get free #DTS1
Not before #GNMGrin #DTS1
Now #SlaveName #DTS1
Set the whole thing up, tell me when you're done #DTS1
[done] #GNMGood #DTS1
@AcceptAnswer #GNMGood #DTS1
I'm starting the timer! #DTS1
Your video begins in 3 minutes! #DTS1
Get into the bondage! #GNMEmoteHappy #DTS1 @Wait(200)
