Hi #SlaveName #DT
It's Halloween! #DT
And instead of our regular session #DT
I have a small game planned for you #GNMGrin #DT
I'm not gonna lie! #DT
It's super difficuilt! #DT
I want you scared #GNMLol #DT
Trust me #DT
You will be scared! #DT
Now listen #DT
You'll facing 5 bosses and they are rather different each of them #DT
Think of this like a pen & paper dungeons and dragons #DT
Well somewhat like that #DT
Not <i>quite</i> .. #DT
If you defeat at least 3 you will be heavily rewarded #DT
No matter how many you defeat #DT
You will earn punishment points #DT
Even if you defeat all 5 #GNMGrin #DT
But the more bosses you defeat you'll be given less and less #DT
Trust me! #DT
You don't wanna die at the first boss #DT
Nor the second #GNMGrin #DT
You won't believe how many punishment points that will earn you! #GNMLol #DT
Feeling scared? #DT
I hope so #GNMGrin #DT
Now this works through written actions #DT
For instance you will be given some info #DT
Then you will be asked #DT
"What do you do" #DT
Here you can try replying with different stuff #DT
You might say block, attack, cast spell or something else entirely #DT
It's all for you to discover #DT
Now you have health #DT
And you have mana #DT
Lose all health and you die #DT
Lose all mana and you can't cast spells #DT
Some stuff will kill you directly no matter your health pool #DT
So thread lightly #DT
And use that horny slow brain of yours #GNMLol #DT
