Believe it or not, I was just thinking about you #DT @CheckFlag(pvNoIce)
@NotFlag(pvStart16A) @NullResponse @Goto(pvNoIce)
And you'll never guess why.. #DT. @DeleteFlag(pvStart16A)
I was just sitting here having a cold drink #DT
And as I was juggling an ice cube with my tongue, I had a funny idea #DT
So, #SlaveName...
Do you have ice cubes in your fridge? #DT
[yes] Good #GNMGrin #DT
[no] Aw that's too bad #GNMEmoteSad #DT @Goto(no ice)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
Here's what I want you to do... #DT
You're going to get a bowl of ice for me #DT
Not just 2 or three cube, it should be a big bowl filled to the rim
Can you do that for me?
[yes] Alright, go get some ice then
[no] Oh, you're no fun, #Name @Goto(not want ice)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Let me know when you're ready...
[ready,done] I bet you're wondering what that bowl of ice is for...
@DifferentAnswer Let me know when you're ready
You're just going to have to wait and see, #Name @TempFlag(pvBowlOfIce)
For know, put it to the side - but keep it within reach
You're should be ready to use that ice however and whenever I say so #Smile @MoodUp

You should make sure you do, #SubName @MoodDown
Just in case I have another frosty epiphany #EmoteLaugh
Will you have some ice the next time I ask?
[yes,maybe] Awesome #EmoteHappy
[no] Oh alright then #EmoteSad @SetFlag(pvNoIce)
[don't know,not sure] Just think about it, #SubName #Smile

You know that's probably not a good thing for you, right? #Grin @SetFlag(pvStart16A)
It means I've been thinking about making you suffer for me
I know you like that though, that you want to suffer
But there's always a chance that I'll find your limit
Maybe today's the day I finally truly break you
Let's find out, #PetName
