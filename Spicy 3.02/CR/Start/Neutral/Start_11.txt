I love how you come to me time after time #DT
You don't even need to be told to do so #DT
You're drawn to me like a moth to a flame #DT
And you know what happens to the moth, right? #DT
[burn,burned,burnt] Oh, things are definitely going to get hot today #GNMGrin #DT
[dies,died,dead,death] Don't be so dramatic, it's just a metaphor #GNMEmoteHappy #DT
@AcceptAnswer I'm going to burn you up #GeneralTime #GNMGrin #DT
I'm the bright flame that you can't help being drawn to #DT
Even if you end up getting burnt, you'll be back #DT
It's just the way it is #SlaveName #DT
