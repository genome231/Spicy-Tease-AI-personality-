Do you love me? #DT
[yes,of course,adore you,worship you] Aww poor #SlaveName #GNMLol #DT
[no] Good, because I don't love you either #DT @Goto(love you either)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
Let's make one thing clear.. #DT.
You may love me, but I don't love you #DT
I don't even <i>care</i> about you, #SlaveName #DT
(love you either)
All I'm interested in is controlling you #DT
Controlling your #GNMCock and your arousal #DT
Turning you into a whimpering, leaky mess #DT
I'm not interested in you as a person #DT
And I certainly don't love you #DT
You're are a toy for me to play with and nothing more #DT

Would I do the things I do to you if I loved you? @Timeout(8,why would I) #DT
[yes] No, #SlaveName @Goto(if I loved you) #DT
@AcceptAnswer @NullResponse I just want to make you suffer, #SlaveName #GNMEmoteHappy #DT
(why would I)
If I loved you, it would be very different #SlaveName #DT
I certainly wouldn't torment you the way I do #DT
(if I loved you)
If I loved you, I would put my arms around you #DT
I would whisper sweet and naughty words in your ear #DT
I would nibble your earlobe and press my body against yours #DT
I'd quietly wish for you to ask me out on a candle lit dinner #DT
I'd want you to hold me and make love to me #DT
But that's not the way things are #DT
And they never will be... #DT

You know #SlaveName... #DT @DeleteFlag(pvLink23A)
There are times I wish I could say I feel sorry for you #DT
I mean, I can be so cruel to you sometimes #DT
The truth is though, I <i>love</i> being cruel to you #DT
So doing those thing makes me happy, and you want to make me happy #DT
That means I really don't have any reason to feel bad about it #GNMEmoteHappy #DT
I guess I can be as cruel as I want, whenever I want to #DT
