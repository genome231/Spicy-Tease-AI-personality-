@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLink21A)
Think about cumming for a moment #DT @SetFlag(pvLink21A)
It's an amazing feeling, sure #DT
I have amazing orgasms all the time, so believe me, I know #GNMSexy #DT
But you know that after that short moment of bliss... #DT
You feel empty #DT
And you might find that it's not just the arousal you miss #DT
Because when that arousal is gone #DT
Much of your obedience to me is gone as well #DT
That's what you really miss #DT
Come to think of it... #DT
Maybe you should never ever have an orgasm again #DT
That way you'll always feel blissfully aroused #DT
And deeply obedient to me #GNMEmoteHappy
Think about that #SlaveName #DT
In your heart you know what it is you <i>really</i> want... #DT

My poor #SlaveName #DT @DeleteFlag(pvLink21A)
The things you do for me... #DT
It's pretty incredible once you stop to think about it #DT
I make you suffer and somehow that gives you pleasure #DT
I make you ache and you just ask for more... #DT
Do you want to ache more, #SlaveName? #DT
[yes] Yes, you do #GNMEmoteHappy #DT
[no] Oh really... @Goto(oh really) #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo
You always want to ache more #MeritChangePLow #DT
@End
(oh really)
That's not the answer I wanted from you, #SlaveName #DT #MeritChangeNLow
But you knew that didn't you? #DT
Maybe you wanted to see what happens when you talk back to me #DT
Is that it? #DT
[yes] So you're testing me... #DT #MeritChangeNHigh
[no] Well, you're going to find out anyway #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo
What do you think happens now, that I will punish you? #DT
[yes] You're right about that, #SlaveName #DT
[no] I <i>am</i> going to punish you, #SlaveName #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
@CallReturn(CR\Punishment\GDSmallBallBusting.txt)
(what you wanted)
But maybe it's what you wanted all along #DT
Because I'm going to punish you by making you ache even more #DT
And the more I make you suffer, the better you feel #DT
#GNMEdge #DT @EdgeHold
#GNMLetTheEdgeFade #DT 
Maybe you think holding an edge isn't much of a punishment #DT
Let's see how you feel about five more... #DT @SetVar[EdgesToDo]=[5]
(edge)
@NullResponse @If[EdgesToDo]<=[0]Then(End)
#GNMEdge #DT @Edge
#GNMLetTheEdgeFade #DT @Wait(#Random(3,10)) @ChangeVar[EdgesToDo]=[EdgesToDo]-[1] @Goto(edge)
(End)
And don't think you'll get much time to recuperate, #SlaveName #DT
