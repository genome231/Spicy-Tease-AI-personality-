You're going to #JerkOff a lot more for me before this is over, #SlaveName #DT @SetFlag(pvLink48A)
I'm sure part of you just wants it to be over #DT
@CheckDate(PDenial, continue) Because you know it's not going end well for you anyway #DT @Goto(not going to end well)
(continue)
Every stroke bring you closer to the inevitable end #DT @GotoDommeOrgasm
(Never Allows)
And you know it's not going to end well for you #DT @Goto(not going to end well)
(Rarely Allows)
You just have to hope that in the end #DT
All those strokes add up to an incredible orgasm #DT
But that's probably not going to happen #DT
And if it doesn't... #DT
All those strokes just add up to a pair of frustrating blue balls #DT
@End
(Sometimes Allows)
You just have to hope that in the end #DT
All those strokes add up to an incredible orgasm #DT
Maybe they will, maybe they won't #DT
And if not... #DT
Then you're in for a frustrating time #GeneralTime #DT
@End
(Often Allows)
And if you get frustrated at times... #DT
Just remember that you'll get rewarded with an incredible orgasm at the end #DT
Well, probably #DT
Maybe I'll deny you and let you deal with a pair of aching blue balls #DT
You never know, #SlaveName #GNMGrin #DT
@End
(Always Allows)
And if you get frustrated at times... #DT
Just remember that you'll get rewarded with an incredible orgasm at the end #DT
You know that I never let you down on that count #DT
Although sometimes I think I probably should #DT
Maybe I'll start with that #GeneralTime #GNMGrin #DT
@End
(not going to end well)
I'm going to tease you over and over #DT
And then I'm going to deny you #DT
So why not get it over with, right? #DT
Every stroke is only going to make the end more frustrating #DT
Sorry #SlaveName, but that's how it is #DT
You're just going to have to deal with it #DT
So grab your #GNMCock #DT
