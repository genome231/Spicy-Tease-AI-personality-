@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLink18A)
I'm going to give you a choice, #SlaveName #DT @SetFlag(pvLink18A)
And you don't get too many of those #EmoteSmile #DT
So listen up #DT
You can either bust your #GNMBalls for me and I'll let you #JerkOff #DT
Or... #DT
@Flag(HasChastity) Your #GNMBalls get a pass #DT @Goto(has device) 
Your #GNMBalls get a pass, but I'm not going to let you #JerkOff for a while either #DT
So what will it be, #SlaveName... denial or pain? #DT
[denial] Too bad, I was hoping for the other one... #DT
[pain] Good choice, I was hoping you'd say that #EmoteHappy #DT @Goto(ball busting)
@DifferentAnswer Denial or pain, #SlaveName? #DT
Well, you're not touching that #GNMCock then... #DT
I can still tease you, of course... #GNMGrin #DT @Goto(add denial)
@End
(has device)
But you have to put on your chastity belt #GNMGrin #DT
So what will it be, #SlaveName... chastity or pain? #DT
[pain] Good choice, I was hoping you'd say that #EmoteHappy #DT @Goto(ball busting)
[chastity] Too bad, I was hoping for the other one... #DT
@DifferentAnswer Chastity or pain, #SlaveName? #DT
But if that's what you want... #DT
Interesting that you would choose your #GNMBalls over your #GNMCock... #DT  @Goto(add denial)
@End
(ball busting)
Either you like the pain... #DT 
Or you just <i>really</i> like #JerkingOff #DT @CallReturn(CR\Punishment\GDSmallBallBusting.txt)
You must have some pretty sore #GNMBalls right now #DT 
But at least your #GNMCock stays free #GNMEmoteHappy #DT 
@End
(pvLink18A)
So #SlaveName... #DT @DeleteFlag(pvLink18A)
Before I make you #JerkOff again #DT
Would you like to bust your #GNMBalls  #DT
Or... #DT
Do one really long edge? #DT
[edge] Alright, if you say so... #DT @Goto(edge please)
[bust,busting,balls] If you say so... #DT
@DifferentAnswer Edge or ball busting? #DT
An edge sounds more pleasurable to me, but okay... #DT @CallReturn(CR\Punishment\GDSmallBallBusting.txt)
With that out of the way... #DT
@End
(edge please)
#GNMEdge #DT @Edge(LongHold,HoldTaunts)
#GNMLetTheEdgeFade #DT 
Must be @RT(toture,a bitch,tough) to start stroking after that... #DT
But you know what I'm going to say... #GNMGrin #DT
