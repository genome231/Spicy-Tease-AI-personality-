I wonder what goes on in your mind sometimes, #SlaveName #DT @CheckFlag(pvLink09A)
I know some of it #DT @SetFlag(pvLink09A)
I know the pure arousal that percolates up from your #GNMBalls #DT
Creeping upward through your veins and infiltrating your brain #DT
I know the feelings of obedience that drive you to obey my commands #DT
But I wonder how far you're really willing to go... #DT
What dark corners of that mind of yours we haven't explored yet #DT
The corners that you barely want to admit to yourself exist #DT
Maybe we'll explore them someday #DT
But for now... #DT

You willingly submit yourself to my every whim #DT @DeleteFlag(pvLink09A) @SetFlag(pvLink09B)
Every instruction, no matter how painful or humiliating #DT
Every aching stroke and every frustrating edge #DT
I don't really understand it, but then again I don't really have to #DT
I can still use it to my advantage #Grin #DT
