Those #GNMBalls look like we should probably untie them, right? #DT  @Timeout(9,untie them)
[yes] I thought so #GNMLol #DT
[no] Aww my little pain slut wants to stay tied up #Grin #DT 
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT 
(untie them)
Let's give them some room to move around #DT 
How else are they going to fill up with all that cum we're making #DT @CallReturn(Custom/CallReturn/pvCr_UnTieMyBalls.txt)
We should probably loosen them up a little, too #Grin #DT @CallReturn(CR\Punishment\GDSmallBallBusting.txt)
That should do it #GNMEmoteHappy #DT

You know, I used to think blue balls were a myth #DT @DeleteFlag(pvLink05A) @SetFlag(pvLink05B)
That it was like a metaphor and that they wouldn't actually turn blue #DT 
But then I started denying guys their orgasms and found out it isn't a myth #DT 
That @RT(testicles,balls) can actually be made to turn blue #DT 
I've been on a quest to find the fastest way to do so ever since #Grin #DT
