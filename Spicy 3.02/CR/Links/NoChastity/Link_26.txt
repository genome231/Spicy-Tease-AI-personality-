@NullResponse @CheckFlag(pvLink26A)
When I tell you to start #JerkingOff again in a moment #DT @SetFlag(pvLink26A)
Here's what I want you to think about... #DT 
With every stroke I own you more #DT 
I want you to really let that sink in, #SlaveName #DT 
Every stroke is like a tiny gift to me #DT 
Each time your hand slides up and down that #GNMCock... #DT 
You give a little piece of yourself to me #DT

I want more from you, #SlaveName #DT  @DeleteFlag(pvLink26A)
More pain #DT 
More aching #DT
More pleasure #DT 
More frustration #DT
Let's not pretend that you can ever satisfy me #DT
That it's ever enough #DT
You can try to please me #DT
And if you do your best, that will make me happy #DT
But I'm always going to want more from you #DT
And you should know that when I want something... #DT
I take it #DT
