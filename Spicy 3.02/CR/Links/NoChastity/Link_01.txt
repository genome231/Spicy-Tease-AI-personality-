@RT(Do you want,Would you like,Are you ready) to @RT(do some,start) #JerkingOff again? #DT @SetFlag(pvLink01A)
[yes] You're @RT(so transparent,so predictable,so easy to read,like an open book) #SlaveName #DT @Goto(startstroking) 
[no] Oh good, @RT(then,that means) I can @RT(take a moment to,go) get myself something to drink #DT @Goto(getadrink) 
[trick] Ooh you think you're @RT(so smart,clever) don't you #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
No it wasn't a trick question #DT
Better luck next time #SlaveName #DT
@NullResponse @CallReturn(CR\Punishment\GDSmallPunishment.txt)
Let that settle in for a second #SlaveName #DT
Now lightly touch the skin of your #GNMCock with your fingertips #DT
Feel how it's aching to be stroked again #DT
I know it's ready for more #DT @Goto(startstroking)
(getadrink)
Don't go anywhere #SlaveName, and don't touch that #GNMCock #DT
You can stare at some #GNMBoobs in the meantime #DT @ShowBoobsImage @LockImages
I'll be right back! @AFKOn @Wait(110)
I'm here #GNMEmoteHappy #DT @AFKOff @UnlockImages
Have you been a good boy while I was away? #DT
[yes] #GNMGood @Goto(startstroking)
[no] You disappoint me #SlaveName #MeritChangeNMedium #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
I gave you two simple instructions: don't stroke and stay put #DT
which one did you not follow? #DT
[first,stroke,stroked,stroking] I should have known #GNMLol #DT
[second,didn't stay,stay put,staying] Wow, I would have thought that was the easy part #DT
[both,neither,none] So... you walked away while #JerkingOff #EmoteFlustered #DT
@DifferentAnswer Which instruction did you not follow, the first or the second? #DT
I really shouldn't have to remind you to follow instructions #SlaveName #DT
@RT(I'm assigning you a series portion of punishment points!,I've added a healthy dose of punishment points..) #DT @ChangeVar[GNMPPoints]=[GNMPPoints]+[250]
