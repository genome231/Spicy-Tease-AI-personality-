It was inevitable, wasn't it? #DT @SetFlag(gdPunNotFirst)
Eventually it would get to the point where I have to punish you, and here we are #DT
So what should we do... #DT @CheckFlag(pvSpankingYes,yes to spanking)
I feel like I should be able to spank your ass, do you agree? #DT
[yes] Good #DT @SetFlag(pvSpankingYes) @Goto(yes to spanking)
[no] Oh, that really limits my options #GNMEmoteSad #DT @SetFlag(pvSpankingNo)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo
But I will respect your limits, as always
@BallTorture @NullResponse @Goto(CBT,CORNER)
@NullResponse @Goto(CORNER)
(yes to spanking)
I can't actually bend you over my knee and spank you from here, obviously
So you're going to have to do the spanking yourself
@Flag(pthevCaneNo) Now, you've already told me you don't have a cane, which is unfortunate @Goto(do not have cane)
@Flag(pthevCane) I already know that you have a cane @Goto(already have cane)
It would please me a lot if you had a cane to smack your ass with, do you have one?
[yes] Good #Smile @SetFlag(pthevCane)
[no] That's too bad @SetFlag(pthevCaneNo) @Goto(do not have cane)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
(already have cane)
@Flag(pvSpoonNo) It would be nice if you had a wooden spoon as well, but okay... @Goto(do not have spoon or cane)
@Flag(pvSpoon) Together with the wooden spoon that gives me options already #Grin @Goto(already have cane and spoon)
@NullResponse @Goto(question spoon)
(do not have cane)
But we're going to have to make it work somehow
@Flag(pvSpoonNo) A solution would be if you agreed to use a wooden spoon... @Goto(do not have spoon or cane)
@Flag(pvSpoon) At least you have a wooden spoon, that's a good alternative @Goto(already have cane and spoon)
(question spoon)
What about a wooden spoon?
[yes] Great #GNMGrin @SetFlag(pvSpoon) @Goto(already have cane and spoon)
[no] Hm #GNMEmoteSad @SetFlag(pvSpoonNo)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo
(do not have spoon or cane)
As always, I will respect your limits
@Flag(pthevLeatherBeltNo) And since you won't use a leather belt either... @Goto(only hand spanking left) 
@Flag(pthevLeatherBelt) There's always the leather belt, I guess #Grin @Goto(SPANKING)
@NullResponse @Goto(question belt)
(already have cane and spoon)
@Flag(pthevLeatherBeltNo) It's not so bad then that you won't use a belt for spanking @Goto(SPANKING)
@Flag(pthevLeatherBelt) And then there's the leather belt... I've got all I need to keep you in line @Goto(SPANKING)
(question belt)
Do you have a leather belt you can use for spanking?
[yes] Awesome #Smile @SetFlag(pthevLeatherBelt)
[no] Oh alright then @SetFlag(pthevLeatherBeltNo)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
It's about time we get to your punishment @Goto(SPANKING)
(only hand spanking left)
I suppose it's going to have to come down to bare hand spanking @Goto(SPANKING)

I need you to tie up those #Balls for me, #SlaveName
Do you have a shoelace or something like that?
[yes] Good @SetFlag(pthevShoelace)
[no] Oh... well we can do this without tying them up @SetFlag(pthevShoelaceNo) @Goto(move on to cbt)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
Go get it for me, because I want your #Balls tied up nice and tight
Do you need me to tell you how to do this?
[yes] Alright then...
[no] Alright then @Goto(go tie up balls)
@DifferentAnswer #YesOrNo
You should start with the string underneath you cock and balls
Your #Balls should be in the middle of the string
Now pull up both ends of the string and wrap it around both cock and balls
Loop around one more time and pull it tight
Not too tight, though: you don't want to restrict the blood flow too much!
Now loop it around just your #Balls and tie a simple knot
Finally, loop it twice around just the base of your #Cock and tie a simple knot on top
The knots should be tight, but easy to loosen in case it start to feel uncomfortable
Safety first, #SubName #Smile
