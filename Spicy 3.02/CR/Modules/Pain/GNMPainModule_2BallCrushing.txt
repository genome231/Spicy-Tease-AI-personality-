#SlaveName @RT(I want to have a bit of fun with your #GNMBalls,Lets play a bit with those #GNMBalls) #DT
#Fetch ball crusher #DT
And attach it #GNMGrin #DT
#GNMReady #DT
[yes]#GNMGood #DT
[no]Hurry up! #DT @Wait(20)
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
Now.. #DT
I need you to tigthen the screws so that it applies pressure to your #GNMBalls #DT
Stop twisting them right before it would start to hurt #DT @Wait(20)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(PainModule2First) @SetFlag(PainModule2First)
Since this is the first we <i>play</i> with your #GNMBalls like this #DT
We need to determine your treshhold #DT
That point where you can't absolutely stand even another single twist! #DT
Now for some terms #DT
Half a twist means to tigthen all the screws a half round #DT
A full twist means to tigthen all the screws a full round! #DT
As simple as that.. #DT
Now for this next exercise #DT
You're going to twist them 1 full round each 15 seconds #DT
I want you to make me proud! #DT
Endure the pain! #DT @SetVar[MaxTwist]=[0]
Say stop when you reach the limit! #DT @CustomMode(stop, Goto, EndIni)
(Twist)
Twist it.. #DT @ShowImage @ChangeVar[MaxTwist]=[MaxTwist]+[2] @Wait(15) @Goto(Twist)

@Variable[MaxTwist]>[20] Well I suppose you wasn't terrible.. #DT @Goto(Continue1)

@Variable[MaxTwist]<=[10] Wauv.. that was awfull! #DT #MeritChangeNHigh @Goto(Continue1)
(Continue1)
Well now that we have that part sorted out #DT @SetVar[TwistRecord]=[0]
You may relieve the pressure on your #GNMBalls #DT @ChangeVar[TwistRecord]=[TwistRecord]+[MaxTwist]
Make sure that tension is still applied #DT
It just shouldn't be painful #GNMGrin #DT

This is going to hurt.. #DT
I want you to fetch a large rubberband #DT
Put the rubberband around the ball crusher #DT
At this point it shouldn't add to the pressure #DT
At least not too much #DT
Now before we play with the rubberband #DT
We need to tigthen that ball crusher #DT
I'm gonna give you a slideshow #DT
With every new picture you are to twist the screws once #DT
I will continue until we reach your highscore.. #DT @SetVar[MaxTwist]=[0] @TempFlag(Busy)

Stand up #SlaveName #DT
In a moment you will pull that rubberband back as far as you can #DT

Just for me! #DT
Give the ball crusher @RT(half a twist,a full twist,two full twists) #DT
#GNMGrin #DT
(Rubber2)
Once again #SlaveName #DT
I'm gonna put on a slideshow #DT
When the picture changes you will pull the rubberband back #DT
When it changes again you release it #GNMGrin #DT @TempFlag(Busy)

I'm gonna show you a slideshow #DT
Each time the picture chages you are to twist half a round #DT
Rather simple.. #DT
When you can't take anymore simply say stop #DT
If you break your highscore you earn 100 gold #DT
If you reach your highscore nothing happens #DT
If you perform well below your highscore I'm gonna be rather disappointed #DT
And you probably don't want to do that #GNMGrin #DT @TempFlag(Busy)

I have a small game for us! #DT
It's a guessing game! #DT
You have to say either "boobs, butt or hentai" #DT
I'll then show you a picture #DT
Guess wrong and you have to tigthen it a full round #DT
Guess right and you can loosen it half a round #DT
When you've made 10 right guesses the game is over! #DT
If you absolutely can't take another twist just say stop #DT @CustomMode(stop, Goto, Stop3)
