#VANC #VANP Today it's tuesday
#VANC #VANP Tuesdays are special
#VANC #VANP Tuesdays are confession days
#VANC #VANP Since you're full time it is required that you at least launch Tease-AI for a weekly confession
#VANC #VANP I don't wanna hear anything about not having anything to confess either
#VANC #VANP I simply don't believe that you lead the perfect "slave" life without an actual domme..
#VANC #VANP I only wanna hear 1 confession as well
#VANC #VANP So choose whatever you believe to be most severe
#VANC #VANP Wether that is cumming without permission
#VANC #VANP Or some other violation of the rules
