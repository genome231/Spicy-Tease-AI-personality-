I bet you're wondering what this key is and what you can use it for..
Well let me tell you!
In total there are 12 different keys
Since this is your first key I can garantie that you don't already have it.
If this wasn't your first key
You could be unlucky and get the same key twice
Well the keys are special #GNMEmoteHappy
They are a 10 digit combination of letters and numbers
3 unique keys are used to unlock a scenario
A scenario is a VERY special day with me #GNMMoan
There are 4 different scenarios so that's 12 keys in total for you to collect
There are the a, b, c and d keys
Once you have the 3 different keys of a certain letter
You will have access to one of my scenarios #GNMLol
I recommend you write the keys down on a piece of paper and save that piece of paper
Unless you have an extreme memory #GNMGrin
Once your confident you have 3 keys of the same letter
All you have to do is write:
"I wanna try open a scenario" at the beginning of a session
