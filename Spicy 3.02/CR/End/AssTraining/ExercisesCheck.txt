Have you completed the last ass assignment I gave you? #DT
[yes]#GNMGood #DT #MeritChangePLow @Goto(Check)
[no]I expect more from you #SlaveName #DT
@DifferentAnswer #GNMYesOrNo #DT
Tell me #SlaveName, why were you unable to complete the assignment?
[forgot,forget] You should know it does not make me happy if you forget stuff #SlaveName! #MeritChangeNHigh #DT @Goto(EndFail)
[no time,missing time,out of time] Even though might sometimes run short on time you still need to follow my orders #MeritChangeNMedium #DT @Goto(EndFail)
[pain,too much,couldn't handle,uncomfortable] You should be able to handle pain #SlaveName #MeritChangeNMedium #DT @Goto(Pain) 
@AcceptAnswer You have to complete your tasks #SlaveName. You want to become a proper slave, don't you? #DT @Goto(EndFail)
(EndFail)
Anyhow not completing your @RT(task,assignment) displeases me #DT @SetVar[ATasksInARow]=[0] @SetVar[AssEXPMultiplier]=[1]
But I guess in the end this means you just don't get to cum #GNMGrin #DT @SetVar[ATasksInARow]=[0] @SetVar[AssEXPMultiplier]=[1]
@End
(Pain)
If it @RT(hurts too much,is really uncomfortable) you should consider getting lube or using more lube #DT
You can also try to carefully stretch your #GNMAss before you start #Dt
You can do that by only entering the tip over and over again or by starting with smaller toys #DT @Goto(EndFail)
(Check)
Let me just update your exp.. #DT @ChangeVar[ATasksInARow]=[ATasksInARow]+[1]
@Variable[ATasksInARow]>=[15] I am very happy #SlaveName #DT @Goto(15)
@Variable[ATasksInARow]>=[10] You will be pleased to hear this #SlaveName #GNMGrin #DT @Goto(10)
@Variable[ATasksInARow]>=[5] Looks like the training is working out for you #SlaveName #DT @Goto(5)
@NullResponse @SetFlag(ATAssignmentDone) @Goto(End)
(15)
You have been completing your ass @RT(assignments,tasks) for 15 days in a row #DT
Thus I will multiply your ass exp by 4 from now on #DT @SetVar[AssEXPMultiplier]=[4] @Goto(End)
(10)
You have completed your ass @RT(assignments,tasks) for the last 10 days #DT #GNMGrin
Because you have been acting that disciplined I will reward you with three times the ass exp from now on #DT @SetVar[AssEXPMultiplier]=[3] @Goto(End)
(5)
You have been following my ass @RT(assignments,tasks) for 5 days in a row now #DT
Thus I will multiply your ass exp by 2 from now on @SetVar[AssEXPMultiplier]=[2] @Goto(End)

@NullResponse @RapidCodeOn @ChangeVar[AssXP]=[AssXP]+[AssRewardEXP]
