Anyhow not completing your @RT(task,assignment) displeases me #DT
But I guess in the end this means you just don't get to cum #GNMGrin #DT @SetVar[CTasksInARow]=[0] @SetVar[ChastityEXPMultiplier]=[1]
Complete your task until the next session #DT

@Flag(CSpikesOn) @RT(If it hurts you should prevent yourself from being aroused with all those spikes in your cage,No wonder it hurts with all those spikes in the cage) #GNMLol #DT @Goto(EndFail)
@Flag(CPiercing) @RT(If the piercing is uncomfortable,If the piercing hurts) you should consider rearranging it or getting another cage #SlaveName #DT @Goto(EndFail)
(SkipCageFlags)
If it @RT(hurts too much,cuts into your flesh,is really uncomfortable,pinches your skin) you should consider getting a new cage or trying different ring sizes #DT
Sometimes it might help to wrap something @RT(soft,smooth) around parts of the cage to make it more comfortable #DT
