[First Round]
I already told you I don't want you to speed up yet
You're not going to stroke faster yet, stop asking
I'm not going to change my mind #PetName
I told you to stay stroking at this exact pace
You can keep asking but it won't change anything #EmoteRandom
[First Round End]
[Stroking]
Don't try my patience #PetName
You're stroking exactly how I want you to stroke
Stop asking me if you can speed up, it's not happening
No means no #EmoteRandom
How many times you #Gonna ask me #PetName?
My answer hasn't changed
I told you #PetName, you're not allowed to stroke faster yet
I'll tell you when I want you to stroke faster #PetName
Not listening to you #Lol
I'm not #Gonna change my mind
You don't get to stroke faster
How bout no?
You're not #Gonna speed up #PetName, stop asking me
[Stroking End]
[Not Stroking]
You're not supposed to be doing anything #PetName
What are you trying to speed up, I didn't tell you to stroke yet
Say what? Do I even want to know what you're doing over there #Lol
[Not Stroking End]
[Edging]
You can go as fast as you want to reach the edge
I don't care how fast you stroke as long as you get close for me
All I care about is that you get close
Stroke as fast as you want, just get close for me
[Edging End]
[Holding The Edge]
Go as fast as you want, just make sure you stay right there on the edge
Go as fast as it takes to stay right there on the edge for me
I don't care how fast you stroke, just stay on the edge
As long as you stay right there on the edge
[Holding The Edge End]
[CBT Cock]
I guess I <i>could</i> let you go faster but I kinda want that #Cock to survive
If you want to smack that #Cock around faster, there's nothing stopping you
You want to smack that #Cock faster, be my guest
[CBT Cock End]
[CBT Balls]
You want to smack faster? They're balls #PetName, not paddle balls #Lol
Nothing stopping you from giving me quicker ball smacks if you want
Smack those #Balls around as fast as you want
[CBT Balls End]
[After Tease]
We're done for now #PetName
