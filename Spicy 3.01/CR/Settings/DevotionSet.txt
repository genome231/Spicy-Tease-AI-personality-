(Info)
DevotionSet is a value set by the sub defining MAXIMUM SESSION LENGTH
To explain this I'm giving an example
By default this value is set at 45:
(1 & 2)
The used variables are reset to 0
[LongSession]=[0]
[MediumSession]=[0]
[ShortSession]=[0]
[SessionLengthFactor1]=[0]
[SessionLengthFactor2]=[0]
[SessionLengthFactor3]=[0]
(3)
The variables are set to DevotionSet which is 45
[LongSession]=[45]
[MediumSession]=[45]
[ShortSession]=[45]
(4)
[SessionLengthFactor1]=[45]
[SessionLengthFactor2]=[45]
[SessionLengthFactor3]=[45]
(5)
[SessionLengthFactor1]=[45] / [10] = [4.5] <-- NOTICE THAT TEASE-AI DOES NOT DEAL WITH DECIMALS SO THIS IS EITHER TURNED INTO 4 OR 5 --not sure which--
[SessionLengthFactor2]=[45] / [10] = [4.5] <-- NOTICE THAT TEASE-AI DOES NOT DEAL WITH DECIMALS SO THIS IS EITHER TURNED INTO 4 OR 5 --not sure which--
[SessionLengthFactor3]=[45] / [10] = [4.5] <-- NOTICE THAT TEASE-AI DOES NOT DEAL WITH DECIMALS SO THIS IS EITHER TURNED INTO 4 OR 5 --not sure which--
[SessionLengthFactor2]=[4.5] * [4] = [18] <-- NOTICE THAT TEASE-AI DOES NOT DEAL WITH DECIMALS SO THIS IS EITHER TURNED INTO 31 OR 32 --not sure which--
[SessionLengthFactor3]=[4.5] * [7] = [31.5]
(6)
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[LongSession]=[LongSession]-[SessionLengthFactor1] <-- [45]-[4.5] = [41.5] <-- NOTICE THAT TEASE-AI DOES NOT DEAL WITH DECIMALS SO THIS IS EITHER TURNED INTO 41 OR 42 --not sure which--
@NullResponse @ChangeVar[MediumSession]=[MediumSession]-[SessionLengthFactor2] <-- [45]-[18] = [27]

(How does this work with #DT) \\#DT decides how "dressed" the domme is in combination with your level of [GNMMerits]
When you launch a session with the domme a timer starts
Short session has the value 13.5, meaning that until the timer hits either 13 or 14 minutes, the domme will be fully dressed.
After 13.5 minutes the domme will get half dressed.
After 27 minutes the domme will get undress to hear underwear.
After 42 minutes the domme will show you her boobs or be completely naked depending on your settings.
NOTICE THAT [GNMMerits] influence her willingsness to undress! Having a low score will likely result in the domme being completely dressed through the session
Also notice that this is all based on default 45 minutes.
If you have chosen a different value, these numbers will vary!
