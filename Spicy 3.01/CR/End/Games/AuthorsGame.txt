So slave! #DT
I hope you've been creative this week #GNMLol #DT
Well as usual I need you to tell me in hours rounded down #DT
(AGNumber)
How many hours did you spend, since our last time together, on writing for Tease-AI? #DT @InputVar[AGHoursSpent]
@NullResponse @If[AGHoursSpent]>[0]Then(AGCorrect) #DT
You didn't input a number that makes sense #DT
Lets say you spent 9,2 hours this week on writing #DT
Then you round it <i>down</i> to nearest whole number which is 9 #DT
And you simply input "9" #DT @Goto(AGNumber)
(AGCorrect)
Well well #DT @ChangeVar[AGHoursTotal]=[AGHoursTotal]+[AGHoursSpent]
So in total you've spent @ShowVar[AGHoursTotal] hours writing since your last ejaculation #GNMGrin #DT @If[AGHoursTotal]>[AGHoursSet]Then(AGGo)
Well I have some bad news.. #DT
It's not enough... #DT
Well next time maybe #GNMGrin #DT @Goto(Deny)
(AGGo)
Well its time for your ejaculation! #DT @SetVar[AGHoursTotal]=[0]
But first.. #DT
