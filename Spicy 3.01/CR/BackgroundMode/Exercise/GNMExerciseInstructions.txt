Hi #SlaveName
With running all you really need is a pair of running shoes
You might want to invest in a runners watch in order to better track your practice
I assume you're a beginner since you've asked for instructions
So here are a few tips..
First you gotta arm yourself with patience
The first 8 weeks are tough
After 8 weeks you should start to feel more comfortable running
This is sometimes refered to as beginners hill
Its gonna feel like you're running up hill
Give it time..
