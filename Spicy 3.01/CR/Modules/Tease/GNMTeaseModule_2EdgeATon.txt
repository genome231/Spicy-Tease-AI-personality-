Well #SlaveName #DT
This is your first edge a ton #DT
It's actually a great way to exercise control over your #GNMCock #DT
Basicly it consists of you edging over and over again and again #DT
There are also competitions #DT
Slaves compete #DT
The rules are rather simple #DT
You are to edge #DT @SetVar[SoftCounterRecord]=[0]
Hold it for 10 seconds #DT @SetVar[EdgeCountRecord]=[0]
Then rest 20 seconds #DT
Edge again #DT
Then at random intervals you will be told after an edge to go completely soft #DT
Once you're completely soft you are to get back on the edge #DT
Before we begin I need to know your soft length in centimeters #DT
And it must be rounded up to nearest value #DT
If your soft penis is 6,4 cm's long I want you to tell me it's 7 centimeters long. #DT
So #SlaveName #DT
(Loop1)
What is your soft cock length? #DT @InputVar[CockSoftLength]
@NullResponse @If[CockSoftLength]>[0]Then(Continue1)
You need to input a number.. #DT
You cant write 4 centimeters #DT
or just 'four' #DT
A simple number like #DT
3 #DT
10 #DT
or 12 #DT @Goto(Loop1)
(Continue1)
#GNMLol #DT
@Variable[CockSoftLength]<[7] Wauv that small! For your sake I hope you're a "grower" #DT
@Variable[CockSoftLength]>[7] Well that seems almost decent #DT
My lover's cock is 13 cm's when soft and he's a grower #DT
Oh my does it grow #GNMGrin #DT
I bet your friend @ShowVar[BlackmailName1] wouldn't be impressed by your size either #GNMLol #DT
Every saturday you can enter an edging competition #DT
The entry fee is 20 gold and you might win 200 gold #DT
But before I'll let you enter the competition you need to complete at least 15 training sessions with me #DT @SetVar[EdgeATonLevel]=[0]
