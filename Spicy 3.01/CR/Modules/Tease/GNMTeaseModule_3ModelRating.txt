I have a fun new game for you #SlaveName #DT
In a moment I'm gonna show you 100 pictures #DT
You will rate each picture from 1 to 10 #DT
I will simply show you the image #DT
And you will simply write a number from 1 to 10 #DT
10 meaning that the image is incredible hot #DT
1 being not so hot #GNMLol #DT

Now that I have all this lovely info #DT
I will have a great new game for us to play #DT
You'll just have to wait and see #GNMGrin #DT
