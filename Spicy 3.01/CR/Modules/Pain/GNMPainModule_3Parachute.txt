(c) \\Corner
You need patience for this one.. #DT
Basicly I want you to go to the corner #DT
Stand there hands above your head and let the weight do it's work #GNMGrin #DT
If you are ever mine, you can expect to stand like that whenever I dont have a need for you #DT
And your chores are complete.. #DT
Go to the corner #DT
Hands above your head and wait for my bell.. #DT

(d) \\Squat
I think it's time for some exercise! #GNMLol #DT
You're going to squat for me.. #DT
You'll hear 3 commands #DT
Down - get down into a squat and stay down.. #DT
Up - you may stand and relax #DT
And on your toes - Stand on your toes, keep your balance.. #DT @SetVar[Timer]=[0] @ChangeVar[Timer]=[Timer]+[#Random(90,150)]
If you're squating and hear "on your toes", then stand on your toes but stay down in the squat! #DT
Now hands above your head! #DT
Get ready! #DT

(e) \\Bottle tilting
Get me a water bottle, preferably 1.5 L one #GNMGrin #DT
Fill it up! #DT @Wait(30)
We're gonna play a game! #GNMLol #DT
You are to use whatever is at the end of your parachute and tilt the water bottle! #DT
Hands above at all times except when you are to raise the water bottle #GNMGrin #DT
The objective is to tilt it as many times as possible #DT
You also need to count the number of times #DT
Just for the fun of it #GNMLol #DT @Wait(15)
Stop and return to me when you hear my bell #DT
Are you ready to start? #DT
[yes]#GNMGood #DT
[no]Hurry up then! #DT @Wait(30)

(f) \\Bent over
I have a fun little play for us #DT
It will require your patience! #DT
Now read these instructions carefully! #DT
I want you to somehow be tied up in manner.. #DT
Where the parachute chain goes up behind you #DT
Forcing you to bend over and stand on your toes to prevent yourself from pulling it #DT
I recommend somehow securing the chain to a door handle or something of similar height #DT
I want you to stand in this position until you hear my bell #DT
Now in 60 seconds you'll hear my bell meaning I've started the timer #DT
The second time you hear my bell is when I want you back with me #DT
Begin! #DT @PlayAudio[\GNMSounds\SpecialSounds\Bell.mp3] @Wait(60)

This was fantastic! #DT @Goto(End)
(g) \\Pulled up
I want you to sit on your office chair and pull the lever so it goes down to it's lowest #DT
Place the key for the lock in the opposite part of your room or perhaps even further away #GNMGrin #DT @Wait(10)
Next I want you down on the floor on your back #DT
Lock the parachute to the office chair #DT
It should locked high enough so you have to lift your ass a little from the floor #DT
Next you are to pull the lever so the chair goes to it's highest setting #DT
Then stay in this position until you hear my bell #DT
When you hear my bell you may begin and make your way towards the key #DT
Not a moment before! #DT
This is gonna get tough! Make me proud and stay patient! #DT
Begin! #DT
