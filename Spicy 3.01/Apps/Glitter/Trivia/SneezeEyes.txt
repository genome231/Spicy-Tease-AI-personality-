It's impossible to sneeze with your eyes open
I don't think you can sneeze and pee at the same time either
I've known people who can sleep with their eyes open though. So creepy :(
Does that mean potatoes can never sneeze?
Why, have you been trying?
I never really thought about that!
She's right, I just tried it. Not happening
People with allergies must spend a lot of time in the dark
