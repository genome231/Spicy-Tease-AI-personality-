Have any of you ever seen a boy hooked up to an electrostim box?
@Cruel My ET312 is my best friend!
@Cruel You should get one, does wonders to a bad sub
@Cruel Ah yes, a little pleasure then a LOT of pain
@Bratty Intriguing!  Call me!
@Bratty Hmm, I hear you can milk a boy?
@Bratty I don't need such things, my tongue is torture enough
@Caring Be careful if you get one, you can damage him
@Caring Don't turn it up too high - ouchy
@Caring Let him control it himself though
@Angry They are expensive, you can't afford one
@Angry You would probably break it
@Angry There goes the electric bill...
