@PlayRiskReady to play some Risky Pick huh? #EmoteHappy @RapidTextOn
(Called From Module)
@NullResponse @CheckFlag(RiskyPickInstructions)
Since we haven't played before, let me give you a quick idea of how the game works @RapidTextOff
The object of the game for you is to win as many tokens as you can
The object for me is to pay you the least amount of tokens I can for the most amount of edges #Grin
When the game starts, you'll pick 1 of the available 24 cases
That's your case for the rest of the game
After that you'll spend 6 rounds eliminating the remaining cases
You'll get rid of 6 cases during Rounds 1 and 2
3 cases during Rounds 3 and 4
And only 2 cases during Rounds 5 and 6
After those 6 Rounds are over, there will be only two cases left
One on the board
And the one you chose in the beginning #EmoteHappy
At that point you will have to select which case to keep
And however many edges it says is however many edges you owe me
You'll also be paid Bronze tokens equal to 1000 divided by the number of edges you do
So if you end up with 10 edges, you win 100 tokens
So you'll see that the only way to actually win a profit is to end up with a case from the bottom row of edges
Now then...
At the end of each round, I will look at the board and make you an offer
A certain amount of tokens for a certain amount of edges
If you decline my offer, we move to the next round
But if you accept, the game ends and we both collect what we're owed #Grin
You may not like my offers at first
But you don't know what case you have or what you're gonna end up with
So you have to decide if you're gonna risk going further
Or pick my deal as the best one you're gonna get all game #Grin @SetFlag(RiskyPickInstructions)
So now that you know how to play...
(RiskyPickInstructions)
Go ahead and pick your case @RapidTextOn
@NullResponse @PlayRiskyPick @ChooseRiskyPick @RapidTextOff

[Risk] Not going for it huh? You know what that means
[Pick] Looks like we have a deal #Grin @Goto(Accepted Offer)
@DifferentAnswer NULL
We're down to two more cases
The one you picked
And the one you didn't #Grin
You only get to open one of them, and that's how many edges you owe me no matter what
So which one will it be? @FinalRiskyPick
[Risk] Want to go with the case you <i>didn't</i> pick huh? 
[Pick] Standing by your original decision, I like that #EmoteHappy @Goto(Chose My Case)
@DifferentAnswer NULL
All right, hope you don't regret going back on your first choice #Grin
Let's see what's inside @Wait(5)

#RP_EdgesOwed edges! @If[#RP_EdgesOwed]>[70]Then(High Edges)

@NullResponse @If[#RP_EdgesOwed]>[7]Then(Medium Low Edges)
You got lucky as hell this time #SubName #Lol @Goto(Figured Edges)
(Last Case One Edge)
1 Edge, lucky you! #Grin
We need to settle up, but that shouldn't be too difficult @Goto(Accepted Offer)
(Chose My Case)
I just hope you don't regret it #Grin
Let's see what's inside @Wait(5)
@NullResponse @RevealUserCase @If[#RP_EdgesOwed]=[1]Then(Last Case One Edge)
#RP_EdgesOwed edges! @If[#RP_EdgesOwed]>[70]Then(High Edges)

You got lucky as hell this time #SubName #Lol @Goto(Figured Edges)
(High Edges)
Looks like you're gonna be busy for a while #Grin @Goto(Figured Edges)
(Medium High Edges)
Not as many as I was hoping for, but still quite a bit #Grin @Goto(Figured Edges)
(Medium Low Edges)
I think you got off kinda lucky #Lol 
(Figured Edges)
Now there's just one more thing to do before this game is finished
We have to settle up #EmoteHappy
(Accepted Offer)
First let's take care of the #RP_TokensPaid tokens I owe you @Wait(4)
@NullResponse @RiskyPayout
And now we'll take care of the edges you own me #Grin
Let's meet back up in chat @Wait(3)
@NullResponse @CloseRiskyPick
So here's the deal #SubName @If[RP_Edges]=[1]Then(Owe One Edge)
You owe me @ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges
You can either do them on your own
Or I can guide you through them
Which would you prefer?
[you, guide, guide me] I was hoping you would say that #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
[I, me] Fine by me #SubName 
@DifferentAnswer Who should handle these edges #SubName, me or you?
Just do your best to have them done by tomorrow
That way when you say hi to me
I know I'll have an extra desperate cock to play with #Grin
In the meantime... @RiskyState
(Owe One Edge)
You only owe me a single edge
So I think we should make it count #Grin
Get to the edge right now @EdgeHold
#GNMLetTheEdgeFade
Well, that was a pretty expensive edge
But I feel like I got my money's worth #EmoteHappy @RiskyState
(Edged By Domme)
#Edge @RapidTextOff @EdgeNoHold @ChangeVar[RP_Edges]=[RP_Edges]-[1]

(Days Instead Of Edges)
#LetTheEdgeFade 
There should be a version of Risky Pick where we play for days denied instead of edges
Maybe I should look into that
The only question is
How many days should be the max #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(I Could Let You Rest)
I could let you rest for a bit @Chance50(You Gotta Be Aching)
But I just don't fucking want to #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(You Gotta Be Aching)
I mean, you <i>gotta</i> be aching right now 
But oh yeah @RapidTextOn
That's kinda the point #Lol @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Probably In A Hurry)
You're probably in a hurry to finish these edges, so... @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Even When These Edges Are Done)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Even when these edges are done
Your #Cock still won't be free of me @Chance50(Stay In Debt)
I might let you have a little break
Or I might just make you keep on edging for me @RapidTextOn
Just because I can #Grin @RapidTextOff @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Stay In Debt)
You can pay off all the edges you want
But at the end of the day when the stroking is done
And you're throbbing, aching with desperation
That #Cock still belongs to me #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(This Many Edges Left)
@ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges left #SubName @Wait(#Random(5,20)) @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Pause For Edge Count)
#LetTheEdgeFade
This is how many edges you have left -> @ShowVar[RP_Edges] @Goto(This is Ass, This is Boobs, This is Random Pic)
(This is Ass) This is a sexy ass @ShowButtImage @Goto(This Is Me Telling You To Edge)
(This is Boobs) This is a pair of #Boobs @ShowBoobsImage @Goto(This Is Me Telling You To Edge)
(This is Random Pic) This is a hot fucking picture I just found @ShowBlogImage
(This Is Me Telling You To Edge)
And <i>this</i> is me telling you to edge again @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(I Love Playing Games)
#LetTheEdgeFade
I love playing games like this @Chance50(Board Game Talk)
The choices...
The consequences
It's nothing I can't make you do already
But I love knowing each of these edges, well
You brought them on yourself #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Board Game Talk)
If we ever played board games together
I'd make sure very game would have some element of risk to it
A certain amount of denial if you lose
Edging every time I rolled a six
You don't even wanna know what I would do to you for rolling doubles #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(RP Edge Count)
#LetTheEdgeFade @If[RP_Edges]=[1]Then(Edge Count One Edge Left)
@ShowVar[RP_Edges] edges left to go
I wonder what's harder on you
Doing these edges for me
Or the things I do to you between each one #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Edge Count One Edge Left)
You only owe me one more edge
Might as well go ahead and get it out of the way #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Who Has A Nicer Ass)
#LetTheEdgeFade
Who has a nicer ass @RapidTextOn
Me
Or this girl? @ShowButtImage @RapidTextOff @LockImages
[you] So you think my ass is better... @Goto(Good Thing Asskisser) @UnlockImages
[she, her, that] Oh really #Lol
@DifferentAnswer Me or her #SubName?
I appreciate your honesty #SubName #EmoteHappy @SetVar[RP_EdgesAdd]=[#Random(5, 10)]
But I still added @ShowVar[RP_EdgesAdd] edges to what you owe me for not picking mine :P @ChangeVar[RP_Edges]=[RP_Edges]+[RPEdgesAdd] @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Good Thing Asskisser)
I guess that's a good thing
Since you apparently like to kiss it so much #Lol @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Know What'd Be Funny)
#LetTheEdgeFade
You know what would be funny? @Chance50(This Would Be Funny)
If after you were done giving me these edges
I made you edge some more for me @RapidTextOn
Just because I can #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(This Would Be Funny)
This... @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Wait For It JK)
Wait for it... @Chance50(Fuck That)
Just kidding #Lol @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Fuck That)
Fuck that #Lol @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Wait For It)
Wait for it... @Wait(#Random(5,20)) @Chance20(Edged By Domme)

<i>Almost</i> there... @Wait(#Random(5,20)) @Chance80(Edged By Domme)
#SubName... @Wait(#Random(5,20)) @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Stare At This Picture)
Now just stare at this picture until I tell you to edge again @ShowBlogImage @Wait(#Random(15,60)) @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(BnB Slideshow)
#LetTheEdgeFade 
As long as you're cooling down 
I've got a slideshow to keep you occupied... @Chance50(Boob Show)
The sexiest asses I found online today #Grin @Slideshow(butt) @SlideshowOn @Goto(Slides Loaded)
(Boob Show)
The best breasts on the internets #Lol @Slideshow(boob) @SlideshowOn
(Slides Loaded)
Go ahead and stare while you cool down
It's okay if gets a little uncomfortable
And you start to squirm
After all
This is to keep you from getting bored
Not keep you from aching #Grin
In fact
You should enjoy it while it lasts
Because once it's over
You're going right back to the edge #EmoteHappy @Wait(#Random(10,30))
Okay, that's enough @SlideshowOff @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(We Should Play More)
We should play games like this more often @Chance50(Direct Control)
I like the competition
Not knowing the outcome
Maybe I'll win big and score a lot of edges
Maybe you'll get lucky and score a lot of tokens
Either way, you have to come back to chat with me eventually
And that's when I show you that house <i>always</i> wins #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Direct Control)
I know I have to give up a little direct control
But I think it's kinda hot leaving the fate of your #Cock up to chance once in a while
How much pleasure you feel @RapidTextOn
How much agony you endure
All down to the roll of the die
The flip of a card
Holding your breath as your entire destiny unravels in a second @RapidTextOff
All it takes to feel a rush like that...
Is for the stakes to be high enough #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(It's Kinda Funny)
It's kinda funny @Chance50(Thought of Debt)
I don't need games like this to make you edge
But it's just so much fun playing games when there's something at stake #EmoteHappy @Chance50(Denial On The Line)
@NullResponse @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Denial On The Line)
Maybe next time we'll play for even higher stakes
Like when... @RapidTextOn
Or if...
You get to cum again #Grin @RapidTextOff @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Thought of Debt)
The thought of you being in debt
And the only way you can pay it off is to edge
I think I would be a pretty good edge collector
Practice makes perfect after all #Grin @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Butt Cooldown)
#LetTheEdgeFade @CheckFlag(RP_ButtCooldown)
I think I'll let you relax for a minute @Chance50(RP Butt 2) @TempFlag(RP_ButtCooldown)
While you stare at this sexy ass and try not to squirm #Grin @ShowButtImage @LockImages
I bet you're looking at it and thinking
"Fuck, do I or don't I want to stroke to that?"
Don't worry #PetName
You won't have to debate that for very much longer #Lol @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(RP Butt 2)
Assuming you even <i>can</i> relax while staring at an ass this hot #Lol @ShowButtImage @LockImages
Try not to squirm too much though
You don't have much of a break until the next edge
And that #Cock needs to recover if it's going to finish the remaining @ShowVar[RP_Edges] #Grin
Then again
Maybe I don't <i>want</i> you to recover
Maybe I just want you to suffer, so... @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(RP_ButtCooldown)
Here's another sexy ass to cool down to #Grin @ShowButtImage @LockImages @Chance50(Then Again Butt)
Just follow the shape of her curves
Imagine how how her ass would feel in your palms
Or the moans she would make if you spanked it
Me, on the other hand...
I would rather hear the moans <i>you</i> make having to edge again #Grin @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Then Again Butt)
Then again, you'll never finish your edges ataring at butts all day, so... @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Boob Cooldown)
#LetTheEdgeFade @CheckFlag(RP_BoobCooldown)
I think you could use some recovery time @Chance50(RP Boob 2) @TempFlag(RP_BoobCooldown)
But I wouldn't want you to get bored, so...
Here's some #Boobs for you to look at while you wait #Grin @ShowBoobsImage @LockImages
I know guys like a nice, full pair of #Boobs
Just like I like a nice, full pair of #Balls #Lol
And yours aren't gonna get any fuller staring at that picture, so... @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(RP Boob 2)
But I don't want you to get <i>too</i> comfortable, so here's some #Boobs #Lol @ShowBoobsImage @LockImages
Yeah, making #Boobs appear is kinda like my super power
Just like it's <i>your</i> kryptonite #Grin
Making you suffer and writhe
Making you weaker for me
And making it all the more vicious 
When I tell you to edge again @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(RP_BoobCooldown)
Here's some more #Boobs for you to relax to #Grin @ShowBoobsImage @LockImages @Chance50(Then Again Boob)
Maybe relax isn't the best word
Suffer to?
Squirm to?
Ache to?
Fuck it @RapidTextOn
Let's just go with all of the above #Lol @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Then Again Boob)
Just kidding #Lol @RapidTextOn @UnlockImages @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(Could Let You Rest)
I could let you rest for a minute @Chance50(You Could Probably Use It)
But I won't #Grin @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
(You Could Probably Use It)
You could probably use it
But the more you rest, the more that desperation's gonna fade, so... @RapidTextOn @Goto(Edged By Domme)
